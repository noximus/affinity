Copy the contents of the zip file (a folder called gold_cart_files) into the wp-shopping-cart folder. Now it should automatically display a new tab called gold options, once you have entered in your API key all of the additional gold features will unlock.
     
Remember to copy the gold_shopping_cart.php file into the wp-shopping-cart folder otherwise the gold tab won't appear.
     
If it does not appear straight away you might need to deactivate and then reactivate the e-commerce plugin.
